# Task Monarch
As a lover of lists and organization, I am always making to-do lists to detail my tasks. I've downloaded many task apps, but I realized most of them boil down to using a simple list system to organize tasks. Throughout my time with these apps and even just using Notes on my phone, I became frustrated with a lot of the limitations and decided to build my own task system. <br>
Task Monarch is based off the tree data structure. Each task can have "children" tasks, which are necessary tasks to fulfill the parent task. In this manner, your to-do list becomes organized in "branches" according to relevance and hierarchy of tasks. <br>
This project is named Task Monarch due to the unique hierarchy characteristic. I imagine starting at the bottom most tasks as a "pawn" until you climb up the tree to become the "king"/"queen" of tasks. 

## The limitations of lists (bullet lists)
* Difficult to establish and organize subtasks
* Tasks get lost when list becomes too long
* Not efficient visualization for long term projects

## Initial phase
There will be two aspects to the inital phase. 
* Creating task bubbles in the browser and building out the tree
* Taking in user input as a form of a bulletted list and outputting a tree. Each tab will signify lower hierarchy. 

## Bigger picture
One aspect of trees I find very appealing is that any node and its children is a tree itself, and any tree can easily be added to a different tree. In the long run, I want to encorporate such aspects into Task Monarch. I believe this will nicely support a more long term task manager aspect to the application.
